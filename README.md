WordStatic
==========

A static Blog System that create static html files

Backend system will be PHP with json files for save data, when we create a page and/or a Blog entry, backend system will create the static html file.

This first version works with Nginx server, but idea is adapt it for several web server systems and also the ability to create html files for systems that only support html (without PHP nor Database), for publish it direct to Google App Engine, ftp enabled system, Amazon Cloud Front and others.

System must priorize simplicity, code standards and speed (with browser cache and option por CDN's).

WS (WordStatic) is in idea stage
